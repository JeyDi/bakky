# Bakky

Plug and play generalize backend system for small and quick projects following best practice standard.

There are a lot of templates, but everytime they are fit to my behaviours.

In this repository I'll put all my expertise and what I have developed over the years in order to use it for personal documentation and as a getting started repository.

Everything open source and should run on-premise without any external service with docker-compose.

I'll try to keep this project maintained and updated meanwhile I'll continue working and learning new things, if you find something strange, you want to discuss and argue about certain topics or propose new things or changes: please open an issue (and try to propose always a solution).

If you find this work useful don't remember to cite me and this repository, if you want you can also contact me for sponsorship or collaboration.
